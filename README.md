# Customer-Segmentation for Targeted Marketing Campaign
Purpose
The financial industry is becoming increasingly competitive, particularly in the realm of interest income generation. This income is derived from extending loans or credit facilities to customers. Consequently, the more credit granted, the greater the interest earned. With data collected from various credit activities, companies seek insights to optimize their strategies. In this context, we possess data summarizing the usage behavior of approximately 9000 active credit card holders over the last 6 months. This data encompasses transaction frequency, amounts, tenure, and more.

The bank's marketing team aims to harness AI/ML to launch a targeted marketing campaign tailored to specific customer groups. To achieve this, the bank must segment its customers into at least three distinctive groups. This segmentation process, known as "marketing segmentation," is vital for maximizing campaign conversion rates. By leveraging unsupervised learning methodologies, we aim to identify patterns within the data and segment customers accordingly. Subsequently, we will analyze each segment to devise the most effective marketing approaches for each.

Problem Statement
This project revolves around developing a customer segmentation strategy to inform marketing tactics. Utilizing the dataset provided, we seek to extract customer segments based on their behavior patterns. By delineating distinct segments, we can tailor the company's marketing strategy to target specific customer groups effectively.
